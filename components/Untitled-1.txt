When the score is displayed, buttons are displayed to either start the quiz over or go back to the Individual Deck view.

Pressing the button correctly creates the deck and routes the user to the Individual Deck view for the new deck.

Logic for notification has been implemented. Notifications are generated at a specific time if the user hasn't completed at least one quiz for that day.
